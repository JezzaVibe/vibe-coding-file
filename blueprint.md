# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the design, features, and development plan for an **Asian Healthy Food Generator**. The application will provide users with a fun and easy way to discover healthy food options from across Asia. It will adhere to modern web standards, incorporating a visually appealing design and an intuitive user experience.

## Project Outline

### Core Functionality
- **Food Generator:** A primary button that, when clicked, randomly selects and displays a healthy Asian dish.
- **Food Database:** A curated list of healthy Asian food items, stored in a JavaScript array. Each item will include a name, image, and a short description.
- **Display Card:** A Web Component (`<food-card>`) will be used to display the selected food item in a visually appealing card format.

### Visual Design & UI/UX
- **Aesthetics:** The application will feature a clean, modern design with a vibrant and "healthy" color palette (greens, oranges, light tones).
- **Layout:** A responsive, mobile-first layout that centers the content and is easy to use on any device.
- **Typography:** The 'Roboto' font will be used for clean and readable text.
- **Interactivity:** The "Generate" button and food cards will have subtle hover and click effects to enhance the user experience.

### Technology Stack
- **HTML:** Semantic HTML for the application structure.
- **CSS:** Modern CSS with CSS Variables, Flexbox for layout, and subtle animations.
- **JavaScript:** ES Modules, Async/Await (if needed), and Web Components for modular and reusable UI elements.

## Current Plan

*   **Objective:** Broaden the theme of the food generator from "Singaporean" to "Asian."
*   **Step 1:** Update the title and header in `index.html`.
*   **Step 2:** Diversify the food database in `main.js` with dishes from various Asian cuisines.
*   **Step 3:** Update the blueprint to reflect the new project scope.
